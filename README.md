# scrna-bcr-cite
scRNA-seq, BCR-seq, CITE-seq on B cells of APDS patients.

The folder "code" has all the code I've developed during the analysis of this dataset but does not have anything in order. It also has code that I have NOT used in my final analysis.

To reproduce the results, only use the R scripts and programs written in the "scRNA" and "BCR" folders.

All paths in my programs are hard-coded. Please make appropriate changes.
